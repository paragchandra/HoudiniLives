# HoudiniLives

Sample project to understand under what conditions an Android device will load native .so files that _are not_ of the device's primary ABI. Many x86 Chromebooks fall into this category, e.g. Samsung Chromebook Pro.

## Prerequisites

- NDK r18b. Other versions _should_ work due to simplicity of C code.
- CMake 3.15.3+
- Android SDK, Build Tools, etc.
